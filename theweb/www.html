    <h1>World Wide Web</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information
        system enabling information to be shared over the Internet through
        simplified ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and
        hobbyists,[1] as well as documents and other web resources to be accessed
        over the Internet according to specific rules, the Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol (HTTP).[2]
    </p>

    <p>
        Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network through
        web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers
        and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through
        character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original
        and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext
        Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images,
        embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that
        implement complex user interaction. The HTML language also supports
        hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide immediate access to other web
        resources. Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of
        following such hyperlinks across multiple websites. Web applications are
        web pages that function as application software. The information in the
        Web is transferred across the Internet using the Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol (HTTP).
    </p>

    <p>
        Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain
        name make up a website. A single web server may provide multiple websites,
        while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by
        multiple servers. Website content is provided by a myriad of companies,
        organizations, government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an
        enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government
        information.

    <p>
        The World Wide Web has become the world's dominant information systems
        platform.[3][4][5][6] It is the primary tool billions of people worldwide
        use to interact with the Internet.[7]

    <p>
        The Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and opened to the
        public in 1991. It was conceived as a "universal linked information
        system".[8]

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
        This NeXT Computer was used by Sir Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and became the
        world's first Web server. The Web was invented by English computer
        scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.[9][10][11] He was
        motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and
        data files in that large and constantly changing organization, as well as
        distributing them to collaborators outside CERN.
    </p>

    <p>
        In his design, Tim Berners-Lee dismissed the common tree structure
        approach, used for instance in the existing CERNDOC documentation system
        and in the Unix file system, as well as approaches that relied in tagging
        files with keywords, as in the VAX/NOTES system. Instead he adopted Ted
        Nelson's hypertext model (1950), in which documents can be linked in
        unconstrained ways through hyperlinks associated with "hot spots" embedded
        in the text. He had used that concept in his private Enquire system
        (1980). The model was later popularized by Apple's HyperCard system.
        Unlike Hypercard, Tim's new system from the outset was meant to support
        links between multiple databases on independent computers, and to allow
        simultaneous access by many users from any computer on the Internet. He
        also specified that the system should eventually handle other media
        besides text, such as graphics, speech, and video. Links could refer to
        mutable data files, or even fire up programs on their server computer. He
        also conceived "gateways" that would allow access through the new system
        to documents organized in other ways (such as traditional computer file
        systems or the Uucp News). Finally, he insisted that the system should be
        decentralized, without any central control or coordination over the
        creation of links.[8][9][10][11]
    </p>

    <p>
        Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal to CERN in May 1989, without giving
        the system a name.[8] He got a working system implemented by the end of
        1990, including a browser called WorldWideWeb (which became the name of
        the project and of the network) and an HTTP server running at CERN. As
        part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP
        protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary
        document format.[12]
