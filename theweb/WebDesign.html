    <h1>Web design</h1>

    <p>
        Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the
        production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design
        include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring,
        including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience
        design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals
        will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process,
        although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is
        normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end
        (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design
        partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web
        development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability
        and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

    <h2>History</h2>

    <h3>1988 &mdash; 2001</h3>

    <p>
        Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other
        areas such as graphic design, user experience, and multimedia arts, but is
        more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large
        part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet
        without animated graphics, different styles of typography, background,
        videos and music. The web was announced on August 6, 1991; in November
        1992, CERN was the first website to go live on the World Wide Web. During
        this period, websites were structured by using the &lt;table&gt; tag which
        created numbers on the website. Eventually, web designers were able to
        find their way around it to create more structures and format. In early
        history, the structure of the websites was fragile and hard to contain, so
        it became very difficult to use them. In November 1993, ALIWEB was the
        first ever search engine to be created (Archie Like Indexing for the
        WEB).[2]

    <h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>

    <p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later became known as the World Wide Web. From 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only HTML pages could be viewed using a simple line-mode web browser.[3] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and naturally text-heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[4] The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability."[5] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a proprietary browser and programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. From 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve at a rapid pace.[6]</p>
